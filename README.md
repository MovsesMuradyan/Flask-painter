#### Description:
     
##### My Project contains 2 subprograms
  
I  : *The first is the C command line tool. which I started writing when I finished my C lectures.
     This command-line tool takes a BMP file (with 24-bit colors) and represents it in ASCII characters*
    
     ##### If you want to print ASCII charecters in Terminal
     Usage: ./painter -i ( input bmp file )
     ##### If you want to take an output txt file with ASCII charecters
     Usage: ./painter -i ( input bmp file ) -o ( output txt file )
